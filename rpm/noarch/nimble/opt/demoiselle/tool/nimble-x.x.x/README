GETTING STARTED
=============================================================================

To get started follow these steps:

- create a DEMOISELLE_HOME environment variable that points to the path of the Demoiselle distribution (the folder contain this file)
- add the /bin folder in the Demoiselle distribution to the PATH environment variable

On a Windows computer these steps are done as follows:

> set DEMOISELLE_HOME=C:\download\demoiselle
> set PATH=%PATH%;%DEMOISELLE_HOME%\bin

On a Unix-like computer these steps are done as follows:

> export DEMOISELLE_HOME=~/download/demoiselle
> chmod +x $DEMOISELLE_HOME/bin/demoiselle
> export PATH=$PATH:$DEMOISELLE_HOME/bin

You can now run the Demoiselle command, as follows:

> demoiselle create-app br.gov.frameworkdemoiselle.sample school
> cd school
> demoiselle generate-crud br.gov.frameworkdemoiselle.sample Student
